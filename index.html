        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p class="mission">With many visits to Children's Hospital and a several overnights spent there, every morning when it came to order breakfast, the picky eaters have a limited selection
            of what they enjoy. Not to mention from the parents perspective, we all know the negative connotation hospital food has. Depending on the time 
            of stay at the hospital, kids tend to lose interest in the few things the hospital has to offer. That is where our foundation comes in, we have been donating small variety boxes of Cereal
            and activites for various children during their stay. Craft items, coloring books, crayons and markers, board games and etc. We also have been donating gift cards to the parents, to help
            aid them with their stay and take something smalloff their mind, such as Doordash and Uber Eats and random restaraunts for them to order and have to worry about ordering hospital food at the 
            small time frame, or taking the hike down to the cafeteria.
